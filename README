SYNOPSIS
      package My::App;
      use Catalyst::Runtime '5.70';
      use Catalyst qw/-Debug ConfigLoader Static::Simple AutoTemplate/;
  
      ...

DESCRIPTION
    This Catalyst plugin rids the programmer of hardcoding template names in
    the stash at the end of actions.

    For example, if an action "/knob/frobnicate" was called, the plugin will
    look for the "root/knob/frobnicate.mhtml" template.

    Why "mhtml"? Here's the fun part. YOU get to adjust what extension is
    used. Just define "template_extension" in your app config, and you're
    golden!
